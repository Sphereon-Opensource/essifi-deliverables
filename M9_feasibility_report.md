# M9 Feasibility Report

The M9 feasibility report should highlight your technical accomplishments
(delivered code + who already used it, achieved functionality, performed
interop work, contribution to standardisation, ...) and how you have achieved
your KPIs/ambitions/goals (e.g. as mentioned in your original application,
and/or agreed at a later stage). Also please include a list of publications
from yourself or from others about yourself in the context of eSSIF-Lab.
