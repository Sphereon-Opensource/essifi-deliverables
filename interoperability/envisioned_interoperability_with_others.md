Envisioned interoperability
===========================

Sphereon's eSSIF Infrastructure project focuses on the interaction between holders and verifiers within an SSI ecosystem. We are working from the standardized [DIF Presentation Exchange specification](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/), and using Verifiable Credentials as per the [W3C Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

Given the opensource specifications and standards on which our project relies, as well as the common need for holder-verifier interactions in any SSI architecture, we see an abundance of possible interoperability avenues to pursue with members both inside and outside the eSSIF Labs cohort.

### Presentation Exchange API Interop
The goal of interoperability is to provide a reliable mechanism for inter-implementation communication and compatibility, as well as
