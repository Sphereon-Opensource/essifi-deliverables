# Functional specification

### Presentation Exchange Models Library & Generator

[Verifier](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/#terminology) and [holders](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/#terminology) of verifiable credentials require transport agnostic data models to communicate across different solutions. The pe-models library provides data models which can be generated and used in different languages and frameworks. This will enable verifiers and holders to create and understand models generated by each other in a consistent and [DIF Presentation Exchange Specification](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange) compliant way.

The pe-models library will also be used in the libraries desiring to validate presentation definition and submissions.
