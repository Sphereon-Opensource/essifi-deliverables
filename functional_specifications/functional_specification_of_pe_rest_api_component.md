Functional Specification of PE REST API

Sphereon's PE REST API is an implementation agnostic, stateful, and platform independent way to leverage the power of [DIF Presentation Exchange v1.0.0 specification](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/). The API can be used without having to implement any of the DIF PE logic. While the PE REST API takes no assumptions about holder's implementation, a holder can benefit greatly by using PE Library as a dependency in the system, as it allows them to submit the response with a high certainty of acceptance. The PE Library will ensure that the information submitted in the response is compatible with the request model of the verifier.

Systems that need a stateful, reliable and compliant DIF Presentation Exchange can use PE REST API with a simple create session call. This will directly enable the caller to have a shareable presentation definition. On each progressive interaction with the PE REST API, the backend updates and keeps track of the status of the exchange. The involved parties can be notified on this status over the provided endpoint. The parties can also enquire the status by calling status check API, eliminating the need to develop and deploy a callback listening endpoint.

The fact that the PE REST API is agnostic to the callers' implementation, allows the verifier and holders to be interchangeable. This allows a holder to initiate a verification for some entity that they want to connect to.
