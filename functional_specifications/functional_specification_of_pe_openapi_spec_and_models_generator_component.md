# Functional specification of PE OpenAPI Models Library & Generator

PE OpenAPI Models Library & Generator will provide the implementation that will enable the developers to use [DIF Presentation Exchange v1.0.0 specification](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/) which is crucial for interoperability of different systems(e.g. wallets etc.) that the [verifiers](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/#terminology) and [holders](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/#terminology) can potentially use. 

This component will enable verifiers and holders systems (e.g. wallets) to create and understand models generated by each other in consistent way. These are some cases where one might use PE OpenAPI Models Library & Generator components.

#### PE-OpenAPI specification

DIF PE OpenAPI specifications implementation is a set of YAML files compatible with the standard. This will be used to generate sdks for Sphereon's PE-REST-API as well. Also, it can be used by 3rd parties directly to generate the models and sdks for their own desired framework and language.


#### PE-OpenAPI Models Generator

PE-OpenAPI Models Generator is a pre-configured component to generate the models from PE-OpenAPI v3 Specification YAML files. The developers who intend to integrate DIF PE specification in their systems can extend this project or follow the guide make it part of their code-bases.


#### PE-Models library

The pe-models library is a pre-published ready to use `typescript` `node-module` that can be directly downloaded and installed from `npmjs.com`. This can be used in any javascript based projects to have a consistent structure of the models required in presentation exchange between verifier and holders of verifiable credentials.

The PE-Models library will also be used in the libraries desiring to validate and verify presentation definitions and submissions.
