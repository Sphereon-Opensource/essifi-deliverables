## About Sphereon
We build technology and products in co-creation with governments, enterprises, software developers and integrators and help you to add a trust-layer to your systems. We focus on Digital Identities and Verifiable Credentials solutions, helping people and businesses to take control of their private data in business, government, healthcare and education applications.

It is our mission to end the digital trust problem that leads to distrust, digital fraud and other digital mishaps. For this we build applications that solve todayâ€™s trust challenges. We're Creating Trust in a Digital World.

## Project Overview
Sphereon, as part of its Vindicatio project, is creating a new DIF Presentation Exchange (PE) for DIF/W3C SSI solutions. The PE will be compatible with Aries Present Proof Protocol v2, and uses a layered approach to achieve both integration and interoperability.

At the lowest layers there are TypeScript (Javascript) libraries for the rules engine component, validations and logic [Presentation Exchange Library](./interface_specification_of_pe_library_component.md). These libraries are easy to integrate in other projects for both web and mobile. The models and generator will be provided as part of the [PE OpenAPI specification and models generator](./interface_specification_of_pe_openapi_spec_and_models_generator_component.md), allowing the models to be generated to a programming language of choice. Then there is the [Presentation Exchange REST API](./interface_specification_of_pe_rest_api_component.md) which exposes the functionality of the PE to be used in any programming language. The REST Api (and state machine) can run in Docker for a more direct integration. 

For the exchange of credentials there is a stateful bridge that integrates DIDComm v2 and CHAPI (and future OpenID-Connect). The bridge will be similar to Aries Present Proof v2 and integrate with it. In the future support for a backend like Verity or similar can be added. This means parties can talk using Presentation Exchange compatible datastructures, across different transports and with different products.
